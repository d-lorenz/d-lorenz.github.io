I am also one of the authors of the R-package VMSbase, a platform allowing processing and analysing VMS, AIS and Logbook data. I am working on the fisheries science subjects from four years now, and I am being involved in different European projects, fully aware of the growing need of an international, interdisciplinary and connected network of scientist to be engaged on the assessment and management of our shared marine resources for their sustainable development and conservation for the future generations.\nManagement of catches, effort and exploitation pattern are considered the most effective measures to control fishing mortality and ultimately ensure productivity and sustainability of fisheries. Despite the growing concerns about the spatial dimension of fisheries, the distribution of resources and fishing effort in space is seldom considered in assessment and management processes. Nowadays, different tracking devices can be used to record the activity of fishing vessels in space and time and to analyze the pattern of fishing effort with respect to sea substrates, resources, or socio-economics factors. Among these devices, the Vessel Monitoring System (VMS) and the Automatic Identification System (AIS) represent the most interesting and fertile data sources for fisheries investigations. The development of state-of-the-art models based on this kind of data can provide an effective way to implement ecosystem approach to fisheries.\n","date":1549324800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"term","lang":"en","lastmod":1567641600,"objectID":"2525497d367e79493fd32b198b28f040","permalink":"/author/lorenzo-dandrea/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/author/lorenzo-dandrea/","section":"authors","summary":"My PhD thesis, ‘Spatial Models for Fisheries Management – Effort, Resources, Environment’, covers the model and the software tool SMART, used to examine the distribution of the demersal resources and the fishing effort; evaluate the current biological production and exploitation patterns; assess the impact of possible administration strategies to put in place simulating different management scenarios.","tags":null,"title":"Lorenzo D'Andrea","type":"authors"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Flexibility This feature can be used for publishing content such as:\n Online courses Project or software documentation Tutorials  The courses folder may be renamed.

VMSbase is primarily conceived to be user-friendly; to this end, a suite of state-of-the-art analyses is accessible via a graphical interface. In addition, the package uses a database platform allowing large datasets to be stored, managed and processed vey efficiently. Methodologies include data cleaning, that is removal of redundant or evidently erroneous records, and data enhancing, that is interpolation and merging with external data sources. In particular, VMSbase is able to estimate sea bottom depth for single VMS pings using an on-line connection to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) database. It also allows VMS pings to be assigned to whatever geographic partitioning has been selected by users. Standard analyses comprise: 1) métier identification (using a modified CLARA clustering approach on Logbook data or Artificial Neural Networks on VMS data); 2) linkage between VMS and Logbook records, with the former organized into fishing trips; 3) discrimination between steaming and fishing points; 4) computation of spatial effort with respect to user-selected grids; 5) calculation of standard fishing effort indicators within Data Collection Framework; 6) a variety of mapping tools, including an interface for Google viewer; 7) estimation of trawled area. Here we report a sample workflow for the accessory sample datasets (available with the package) in order to explore the potentialities of VMSbase. In addition, the results of some performance tests on two large datasets (1×105 and 1×106 VMS signals, respectively) are reported to inform about the time required for the analyses. The results, although merely illustrative, indicate that VMSbase can represent a step forward in extracting and enhancing information from VMS/logbook data for fisheries studies.\n","date":1576837576,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1576837576,"objectID":"28afa5d5cf70cd62910ed3076a021b50","permalink":"/project/vmsbase/","publishdate":"2019-12-20T11:26:16+01:00","relpermalink":"/project/vmsbase/","section":"project","summary":"process and visualize fishing vessels activity","tags":["Data Analysis","Fisheries Management"],"title":"vmsbase","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"The project’s overall objective is the gradual elimination of discards in European marine fisheries.

To identify when and where fishing activities occur, analysis needs to take account of different fishing practices in different fleets. Small-scale fisheries (SSFs) vessels have generally been exempted from positional reporting requirements, but recent developments of compact low-cost systems offer the potential to monitor them effectively. To characterize the spatial distribution of fishing activities in SSFs, positions should be collected with sufficient frequency to allow detection of different fishing behaviours, while minimizing demands for data transmission, storage, and analysis. This study sought to suggest optimal rates of data collection to characterize fishing activities at appropriate spatial resolution. In a SSF case study, on-board observers collected Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) position and fishing activity every second during each trip. In analysis, data were re-sampled to lower temporal resolutions to evaluate the effect on the identification of number of hauls and area fished. The effect of estimation at different spatial resolutions was also explored.

Nevertheless, tracking devices usually allow monitoring of the largest length classes composing different fleets, whereas fishing vessels below a regulatory threshold (i.e., 15 m in length-over-all) are not mandatorily equipped with these tools. This issue is critical, since 36% of the vessels in the European Union (EU) fleets belong to these “hidden” length classes. In this study, a model [namely, a cascaded multilayer perceptron network (CMPN)] is devised to predict the annual fishing footprints of vessels without tracking devices. This model uses information about fleet structures, environmental characteristics, human activities, and fishing effort patterns of vessels equipped with tracking devices. Furthermore, the model is able to take into account the interactions between different components of the fleets (e.g., fleet segments), which are characterized by different operating ranges and compete for the same marine space. The model shows good predictive performance and allows the extension of spatial analyses of fishing footprints to the relevant, although still unexplored, fleet segments.","tags":["Fishery","Footprint","Prediction","AIS","VMS","Neural Network","Spatial"],"title":"Predicting fishing footprint of trawlers from environmental and fleet data: an application of artificial neural networks","type":"publication"},{"authors":["S Franceschini","F Mattei","L D'Andrea","A Di Nardi","F Fiorentino","G Garofalo","M Scardi","S Cataudella","T Russo"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"7cfb903c5f285369e7cd70f946f78afc","permalink":"/publication/franceschini-2019-rummaging/","publishdate":"2019-12-17T09:31:41.670399Z","relpermalink":"/publication/franceschini-2019-rummaging/","section":"publication","summary":"Marine litter has significant ecological, social and economic impacts, ultimately raising welfare and conservation concerns.

Therefore, management actions to achieve a more sustainable exploitation of fishery resources are required and compelling. In this study, a spatially explicit multi-species bio-economic modeling approach, namely, SMART, was applied to the case study of central Mediterranean Sea to assess the potential effects of different trawl fisheries management scenarios on the demersal resources. The approach combines multiple modeling components, integrating the best available sets of spatial data about catches and stocks, fishing footprint from vessel monitoring systems (VMS) and economic parameters in order to describe the relationships between fishing effort pattern and impacts on resources and socio-economic consequences. Moreover, SMART takes into account the bi-directional connectivity between spawning and nurseries areas of target species, embedding the outcomes of a larvae transport Lagrangian model and of an empirical model of fish migration. Finally, population dynamics and trophic relationships are considered using a MICE (Models of Intermediate Complexity) approach. SMART simulates the fishing effort reallocation resulting from the introduction of different management scenarios. Specifically, SMART was applied to evaluate the potential benefits of different management approaches of the trawl fisheries targeting demersal stocks (deepwater rose shrimp Parapenaeus longirostris, the giant red shrimp Aristaeomorpha foliacea, the European hake Merluccius merluccius, and the red mullet Mullus barbatus) in the Strait of Sicily. The simulated management scenarios included a reduction of both fishing capacity and effort, two different sets of temporal fishing closures, and two sets of spatial fishing closures, defined involving fishers. Results showed that both temporal and spatial closures are expected to determine a significant improvement in the exploitation pattern for all the species, ultimately leading to the substantial recovery of spawning stock biomass for the stocks. Overall, one of the management scenarios suggested by fishers scored better and confirms the usefulness of participatory approaches, suggesting the need for more public consultation when dealing with resource management at sea.","tags":["SMART","Management","Bio-Economic","Simulation","VMS","Mediterranean","MICE"],"title":"Simulating the effects of alternative management measures of trawl fisheries in the Central Mediterranean Sea: application of a multi-species bio-economic modelling approach","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Tommaso Russo","Paolo Carpentieri","Lorenzo D'Andrea","Paola De Angelis","Fabio Fiorentino","Simone Franceschini","Germana Garofalo","Lucio Labanchi","Antonio Parisi","Michele Scardi"," others"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"420270736b0e2eaefcd8154371175c49","permalink":"/publication/russo-2019-trends/","publishdate":"2019-12-17T09:31:41.666951Z","relpermalink":"/publication/russo-2019-trends/","section":"publication","summary":"The rationale applied for monitoring and managing fisheries is based on the implicit assumption that yield and stocks status is essentially determined by fisheries. Moreover, the fisheries yield is quantified and analyzed in terms of landings with respect to official management area of registration of vessels. In this way, the real area of activity of each fleet is not considered and this prevent an effective spatial analysis of the factors affecting fisheries yield and stocks status. This paper firstly presents a VMS-based reconstruction of the fishing effort and of the area of activity of the Italian trawlers in the Mediterranean Sea. The fishing area of each fleet is then used as a spatial reference to estimate primary productivity rate and gross primary production and to investigate, by using General Additive Models, the effects of trawling effort, primary production and time on fisheries yield, fisheries productivity and overexploitation rate for some key demersal species. The results evidence that the usage of satellite-based information of fishing activities and of primary production, when combined at the real spatial scale of fishing activities, could effectively improve our ability to analyze the response of the ecosystems to these driving forces and allow capturing the main trends of yield, productivity and overexploitation rate of demersal stocks.","tags":["Fishery","Management","Yield","Status","VMS","Mediterranean","GAM"],"title":"Trends in effort and yield of trawl fisheries: a case study from the Mediterranean Sea","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Francois Bastardie","Jörg Berkenhagen","Isabella Bitetto","Oisin Callery","Paul Coleman","Lorenzo D'Andrea","Jochen Depestele","Hans Frost","David Goldsborough","Katell Hamon"," others"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"88db279279f97cc284c767fb28a8a4b7","permalink":"/publication/bastardie-2019-workshop/","publishdate":"2019-12-17T09:31:41.671639Z","relpermalink":"/publication/bastardie-2019-workshop/","section":"publication","summary":"Indicators of impacts from human activities on benthic habitats (including bottom trawling) are being developed and operationalised to assess the achievement of Good Environmental Status within the EU Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD);(Descriptor 1 on maintaining the biodiversity, Descriptor 6 on seafloor integrity).

For data collection, the Adriatic Sea is divided into two management areas (namely FAO Geographical Sub-Areas–GSAs). To account for these spatial patterns while using the data available, we propose a method for estimating the monthly landings of Italian trawlers operating in the Adriatic Sea at a higher spatial resolution than the GSA. We use a stepwise approach based on the combined analysis of questionnaire-derived vessel-specific landings and the spatial activity of the vessels with respect to a set of fishing grounds. Thus, we sequentially 1) analyze the available vessel monitoring system data, 2) partition the study area into fishing grounds (the origin of the landings), 3) cross analyze vessel-specific fishing efforts with the available vessel-specific monthly landings to estimate the LPUE of each fishing ground, and 4) estimate the monthly landings (by vessel, fishing ground, and harbor) for the whole fleet and the monthly fluxes between fishing grounds (origin) and landing harbors (the destination of the landings). We apply the method to two species: the Norway lobster and the European hake. For both species, we find a few fishing grounds to be consistently more productive than others and the landings per harbor to vary greatly but with few harbors regularly receiving a significant share. In particular, the results suggest that the Pomo/Jabuka pit area represents a critical area for both species. Additional outcomes include a detailed characterization of the activity of the Adriatic bottom trawling fleet, highlighting the strengths and shortcomings of the official data available.

Submarine canyons are complex environments that can harbor high biodiversity of benthic ecosystems and high biomass of fish species, thus representing preferential fishing areas for bottom trawling fleets. The effects of bottom trawling on the benthic epifauna were investigated over the soft-bottom margins of the Gioia Canyon (Southeastern Tyrrhenian Sea) by means of quantitative analysis of Remote Operated Vehicle (ROV) video transects and compared with the recent pattern of trawling intensity, reconstructed through processing of data collected with the Vessel Monitoring System (VMS). Four ROV transects were then performed at 320–540 m depth in areas affected by different trawling pressure. The analysis was focused on the bamboo coral Isidella elongata and the sea pen Funiculina quadrangularis, which are considered indicator taxa of Vulnerable Marine Ecosystems (VMEs) and relevant in terms of sustainable management priorities. I. elongata only occurred at the two deeper stations, below 400 m depth. This species showed a clear relationship with trawling intensity, since its abundance was significantly higher under low trawling intensity, where coexistence of large (20 cm height) and small colonies was observed. The relatively high prevalence of small colonies in areas exposed to higher trawling effort was interpreted as a consequence of the trawling activity that removed the larger colonies. However, the frequent occurrence of dead colonies and the diffuse presence of epibionts (e.g. the anemone Amphianthus dohrnii and the hydroid Clytia linearis) on living colonies indicate stressful conditions for I. elongata even in areas where trawling intensity was lower. Conversely, the relationship between trawling intensity and species abundance was not straightforward for F. quadrangularis; despite the lowest abundance of this species was recorded in areas subject to high trawling intensity, relatively high abundances were observed in areas with intermediate trawling effort. Although such distribution may be driven by other environmental factors, it suggests that vulnerability to bottom trawling can be different for the two species.","tags":["Impact","Mediterranean","Tyrrhenian","ROV","VMS","Vulnerable Marine Ecosystems","Coral","Trawling"],"title":"Effects of trawling activity on the bamboo-coral Isidella elongata and the sea pen Funiculina quadrangularis along the Gioia Canyon (Western Mediterranean, southern Tyrrhenian Sea)","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Alessandro Lucchetti","Andrea Belardinelli","Lorenzo D’Andrea","Bojan Marčeta","Michela Martinelli","Tommaso Russo","Vanja Čikeš Keč","Barbara Zorica","Massimo Virgili"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1514764800,"objectID":"a0133e1ad59b0213c282ec415bfca0a1","permalink":"/publication/lucchetti-2018-small/","publishdate":"2019-12-17T09:31:41.66573Z","relpermalink":"/publication/lucchetti-2018-small/","section":"publication","summary":"A number of restrictions envisaged by Council Regulation 1967/2006 (Mediterranean Regulation, MR) have been introduced to reduce the fishing effort and the catch of juveniles in the Mediterranean Sea. A large proportion of the purse seiners of the Adriatic fleet that target small pelagic species may be using gear that does not comply with regulatory provisions. This study provides a thorough overview on Adriatic purse seine designs and fishing practices. Moreover, since no detailed information was available about their environmental impact, an ad hoc study was also performed to examine the issue in relation to Mediterranean Regulation provisions. Analysis of the technical data confirmed the vast majority of the nets used by the Adriatic purse seine fleet do not comply with regulatory provisions. However, data analysis highlighted that the technical features and operational characteristics of these fisheries do not justify the application of MR restrictions. In fact, i) spatial analysis of the fishing effort demonstrated that purse seiners operate more than 3 nautical miles off the coast, i.e. further than the area covered by the restrictions; and ii) data from sensors and video cameras documented that purse seines do not exert adverse impacts on critical habitats such as Posidonia meadows and that the groundrope impact on the seabed is so slight and short-lived as to be negligible. Moreover, the extensive changes required to make purse seines compliant with the MR would entail steep costs and would ultimately render the nets unsuitable for commercial fishing, thus involving highly negative socioeconomic consequences.","tags":["Mediterranean","Purse Seine","Adriatic","Fishing Effort","Spatial Analysis"],"title":"Small pelagic purse seines in the Adriatic Sea: A spatial analysis and technical overview in relation to Mediterranean Regulation provisions","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Tommaso Russo","Isabella Bitetto","Pierluigi Carbonara","Roberto Carlucci","Lorenzo D'Andrea","Maria T Facchini","Giuseppe Lembo","Porzia Maiorano","Letizia Sion","Maria T Spedicato"," others"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1483228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1483228800,"objectID":"dd82d837371121e6ef82ed86ec5553d4","permalink":"/publication/russo-2017-holistic/","publishdate":"2019-12-17T09:31:41.661384Z","relpermalink":"/publication/russo-2017-holistic/","section":"publication","summary":"The new Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) is designed to represent an appropriate response to the uncertainties and challenges facing the fisheries sector. It also adopts a holistic approach to fisheries management, considering all factors driving fishers' behavior, and ultimately, the long-term maintenance of living resources. The most reliable way to pursue these aims could be represented by a change in the exploitation pattern, in order to guarantee the sustainability of fisheries without compromising their socioeconomic viability. In this paper, the demersal fisheries of the Ionian Sea [Geographic Sub-area (GSA) 19] were analyzed with respect to their spatial, temporal, economic, and biological characteristics in terms of four key species for fisheries, namely European hake, red mullet, giant red shrimp, and deep-water rose shrimp. Specifically, (1) a quantitative procedure was applied to break down the whole system (including small-scale fleet components) into a series of fishing grounds using input data about fishing efforts; (2) the different fleet segments were defined as a combination of main gear and fishing grounds; (3) the effort and production by fleet segment were derived according to biological samplings of commercial data (Data Collection Framework for the collection and management of fisheries data, DCF), information on localization of nursery and spawning grounds, and expert knowledge; and (4) all this information was used to feed a bioeconomic modeling tool (BEMTOOL), and to explore alternative exploitation patterns. A series of scenarios including the status quo were defined, starting from the actual management approach based on temporal fishing closure. The results showed that significant improvements in the exploitation pattern could be achieved by setting up spatial and/or temporal gear-specific bans of the fishing activity. More specifically, scenarios based on a 3-month fishing ban for trawlers are expected to provide high rebuilding of the spawning stock biomass (SSB) for all target stocks, and at the same time, result in a remarkable reduction of discards. When combined with a seasonal fishing ban for small-scale fleets equipped with nets and longlines, this approach could lead to a significant improvement in all indicators, but especially the SSB of the exploited species.","tags":["CFP","Exploitation","Fishery","Management","DCF","Ionian","MPA"],"title":"A holistic approach to fishery management: evidence and insights from a central mediterranean case study (Western Ionian Sea)","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Lorenzo D'Andrea","吳恩達"],"categories":["Demo","教程"],"content":"Create a free website with Academic using Markdown, Jupyter, or RStudio.

Among these devices, the Vessel Monitoring System (VMS) and the Automatic Identification System (AIS) represent the most interesting and fertile data sources for fisheries investigations but an integration of these two sources was never explored. Two large VMS and AIS datasets, covering the activity of the Italian fishing vessels with length-over-all ≥15 m for the whole year 2012, were used to perform the first assessment of the features characterizing each data source, and ultimately the properties of the estimators of ecological indicators of fishing pressure obtained using these data. In this way, a dataset related to five vessels equipped by a third high frequency device (the Fishing Observing System) was used as reference for a comparative analysis of fishing activity as reconstructed by VMS and/or AIS. Moreover, the ecological indicator 5 of fishing pressure as spatial extent of fishing activity (defined within the Data Collection Framework for Fisheries—DCF) was used as a reference to test the separate and integrated usage of VMS and AIS data. Results evidenced important differences in spatial, temporal and fleet coverage between VMS and AIS. Namely, VMS is affected by a lower frequency with respect to AIS but covers a larger portion of the fleet. Furthermore, AIS mainly operates near the harbours, so that offshore activity is underrepresented. The integration of VMS and AIS data, however, allows valorising the strengths and minimizing the limits of each source. In fact, the assessment of the total spatial extent of fishing activities (as captured by the DCF indicator 5) is significantly improved by the integrated usage of VMS and AIS data.","tags":["Fishery","Spatial","AIS","VMS","Mediterranean","DCF"],"title":"Assessing the fishing footprint using data integrated from different tracking devices: Issues and opportunities","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":["R"],"content":" R Markdown This is an R Markdown document.

VMSbase is primarily conceived to be user-friendly; to this end, a suite of state-of-the-art analyses is accessible via a graphical interface. In addition, the package uses a database platform allowing large datasets to be stored, managed and processed vey efficiently. Methodologies include data cleaning, that is removal of redundant or evidently erroneous records, and data enhancing, that is interpolation and merging with external data sources. In particular, VMSbase is able to estimate sea bottom depth for single VMS pings using an on-line connection to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) database. It also allows VMS pings to be assigned to whatever geographic partitioning has been selected by users. Standard analyses comprise: 1) métier identification (using a modified CLARA clustering approach on Logbook data or Artificial Neural Networks on VMS data); 2) linkage between VMS and Logbook records, with the former organized into fishing trips; 3) discrimination between steaming and fishing points; 4) computation of spatial effort with respect to user-selected grids; 5) calculation of standard fishing effort indicators within Data Collection Framework; 6) a variety of mapping tools, including an interface for Google viewer; 7) estimation of trawled area. Here we report a sample workflow for the accessory sample datasets (available with the package) in order to explore the potentialities of VMSbase. In addition, the results of some performance tests on two large datasets (1×105 and 1×106 VMS signals, respectively) are reported to inform about the time required for the analyses. The results, although merely illustrative, indicate that VMSbase can represent a step forward in extracting and enhancing information from VMS/logbook data for fisheries studies.","tags":["Fishery","VMS","AIS","Database","Processing","R"],"title":"VMSbase: an R-package for VMS and logbook data management and analysis in fisheries ecology","type":"publication"}]
